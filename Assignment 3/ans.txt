The cryptosystem used in this level is Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher along with Permutation(Transposition) Cipher with the block size of length 5.

In  Monoalphabetic substitution cipher what happens is a letter is always substituted by a particular letter only.
For example: Suppose ‘a’ can be enciphered as ‘d’ everywhere then this is monoalphabetic cipher.

 In  Polyalphabetic substitution cipher what happens is a letter is substituted by different different letter.
For example: For example, ‘a’ can be enciphered as ‘d’ in the starting of the text, but as ‘n’ at the middle.

In Permutation cipher, we just permute/rearrange the characters present in a block.The permutation is given by a key.

In this level the Permutation key is:
CipherText: 12345
Permutation : 45213
Decryption Key

This means that 1st letter of CipherText goes to the 4th letter of plaintext and 2nd letter of CipherText goes to 5th letter of plaintext and  so on..

In this Level we have used Substitution Cipher along with the Permutation Cipher and here the block size is 5.
