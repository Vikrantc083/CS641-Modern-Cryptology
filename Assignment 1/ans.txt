The CryptoSystem used in this level is Substitution Cipher .The Substitution cipher used in this level is Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher because here we are replacing each letter/digits/punctuation marks with only one character.

In  Monoalphabetic substitution cipher what happens is a letter is always substituted by a particular letter only.
For example: Suppose ‘a’ can be enciphered as ‘d’ everywhere then this is monoalphabetic cipher.

 In  Polyalphabetic substitution cipher what happens is a letter is substituted by different different letter.
For example: For example, ‘a’ can be enciphered as ‘d’ in the starting of the text, but as ‘n’ at the middle.

In this Level we have Substitution Cipher(Mono-Alphabetic)
